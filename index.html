        <h2><li>Taylor Swift – 29.10 billion</li></h2>
         <img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8b84bab619f8d35cc6438a96a38eea17d79818/0_55_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=1900&dpr=2&s=none" width="600" height="400" alt="taylor swift picture " >
         <p>29.10 billion streams in a year. An average of 79.73 million streams per day, or 55,365 streams every minute, all year long. Spotify averaged 550 million users for the year, assuming 4 minutes per song, it means every user listened to Taylor Swift an average of 12,698 seconds in 2023. All these numbers are absolutely ridiculous.

            Of course, this insane total, which see her climb to 68.04 billion career streams, within striking distance to Drake all-time record, comes with plenty of records. She more than doubles her near 14 billion streams from last year, at least moving ahead of Bad Bunny after being his runner up in both 2021 and 2022. It’s even more impressive when we 
            know that Spotify is much less favorable to her streams, and that she also sells tons of pure copies of her albums.Speaking about them, as previously mentioned, Midnights has been the most streamed album of the year at 4.86 billion streams, although the official rewards went to Un Verano Sin Ti. Lover is 6th at 3.60 billion, Folklore 11th at 2.80 billion,
             1989 (original) 12th at 2.79 billion, and reputation is 17th at 2.44 billion. Newly released 1989 (Taylor’s Version) recorded 1.99 billion streams during the year too.<br>

        <h2><li> Bad Bunny – 16.37 billion</li></h2>

         <p>The history making run of Puerto Rican icon Bad Bunny came to an end in 2023, despite magnificent performances by himself. He led the streaming rankings for 3 years in a row, topping the all-time record for most streams in a year each time from 2020 to 2022. That latter year, he was the first ever to crack 10 billion, setting the bar at an insane 19.2 billion. Just when we though this record was out of touch for quite some time, 
            it was destroyed straight away.The reggaeton master closes 2023 with an additional 16.37 billion streams, adding up to 67.00 billion overall. This is less than 15% down from last year, despite the new album not doing as much as anticipated. Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va A Pasar Mañana is just below 2.5 billion, a solid number but very far away from the near 9.5 billion registered by Un Verano Sin Ti last year.

            Another Canadian superstar does wonders, as The Weeknd ties his career best ranking in 2023. The 3rd most streamed artist for the year, he does as well as in both 2015 and 2017. His new 2022 album was heavily anticipated after the historical success of Blinding Lights, the most streamed track ever on Spotify.Ironically, Dawn FM hasn’t done as well as expected, although the long standing power of The Weeknd‘s 
            albums brought it to 3.9 billion streams already. The real shocker instead came from his back catalog, especially 2016’s Starboy.With 4.35 billion streams this year, it was the 4th most streamed album in 2023. This unbelievable comeback made it climb from outside of the top 10 to the 3rd spot among the most streamed albums ever. As it wasn’t enough, 2020’s After Hours added over 2.5 billion streams to its tally,
            the 13th top performer of the year overall.These amazing statistics concluding on his top result streams-wise, with a stunning 14.14 billion plays for the year, bringing his career total to 51.68 billion.<br/>

        <h2><li>  Drake – 14.03 billion</li></h2>

         <p>From 2015 to date, nobody has been as consistent as Drake. He ranked 8 times out of 9 inside Spotify’s annual top 5, leading the way 3 times in 2015, 2016, and 2018. He only missed that top 5 in 2019 due to a stacked list and a lack of releases from him.
            2023 was a pivotal year for the Canadian hip hop superstar. 2022’s Honestly, Nevermind was his first flop album, only a few months after the arrival of Certified Lover Boy which failed to create the hype of its predecessors. Late last year, the collaboration album with 21 Savage Her Loss already started to turn things around, and his new For All the Dogs confirmed he wasn’t going anywhere yet.
            The last two albums are up to 2.7 billion streams and 1.6 billion streams, respectively, with the latter still posting over 10 million a day. His extensive catalog, which contains a record breaking 178 lead tracks with over 100 million streams, making him virtually unstoppable.
            Now up to an all-time record of 70.17 billion streams, he got 14.03 billion of them in 2023 alone, up from just below 10 billion last year, and just over 8 billion in 2021.
            53.74 to 70.18 gained 2.3 from features moving to lead <br><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3TVXtAsR1Inumwj472S9r4"> click here for spotify link </a>

        <h2><li> Eminem – 8.86 billion</li></h2>  
         <img src="https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/87e50b0c982138dd55134de4231c8806/resize/1320/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2022/10/19/16661328920205.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="the eminem iamge ">  
         <p>The only artist to debut more than 20 years ago inside the top 20, Eminem can’t miss. His catalog is so strong that he is a surefire top performer every year, even if he releases only a couple of verses as he did in 2023. The rap god hasn’t been among the top 5 artists of the year since he was runner up in 2014. He is never too far away from the top yet.
            At 6.86 billion, his streams in 2023 were once again truly big, slightly up from his 6.27 billion plays in 2022. No less than 5 of his tracks feature frequently inside the global 200 chart, Without Me, Mockingbird, The Real Slim Shady, Godzilla and Lose Yourself.
            Now 51, Eminem hasn’t released a new album in nearly 4 years. His large fan base eagerly awaits his comeback, that should see him enjoy significant success, once again. That would push him over 40 billion easily, as he is now on 39.54 billion.<br>
